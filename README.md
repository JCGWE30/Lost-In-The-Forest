# Lost-In-The-Forest
The plugin i worked on for a long time. I mostly used it to express my creativity, and learn new things about spigot. I also come back to it every now and then for just that

Its worth noting some parts of this plugin are VERY OUTDATED. I also did not use maven on this and dont feel like switching as of right now
